# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between you ("Contributor") and the Firewall Project ("Project") to clarify the intellectual property license granted with your contributions.

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution to the Firewall Project, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. License Grant

You hereby grant to the Project and its successors a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under your intellectual property rights in the contribution to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the contribution and such derivative works in source code or other forms.

### 2. Dual Licensing

You understand and agree that your contribution will be licensed under the Project's dual licensing model:

- **AGPL v3.0**: For open source use, community contributions, and non-commercial purposes
- **Commercial License**: For proprietary use by companies who require different licensing terms

### 3. Patent License

You grant to the Project and its successors a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contribution alone or by combination of your contribution with the Project to which you contributed.

### 4. No Additional Rights

You are not required to provide support for your contribution, except to the extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you provide your contribution on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 5. Original Work

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions, or that your employer has executed a separate Contributor License Agreement.

### 6. Third Party Content

You represent that each contribution you submit includes complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your contribution.
